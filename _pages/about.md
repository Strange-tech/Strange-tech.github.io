I'm a master's student at the [School of Software](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). I research the lightweight processing of large-scale urban point clouds, focusing on geometry in computer graphics and instance detection in computer vision. I'm advised by [Prof. Jinyuan Jia](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=467) from [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).

Basketball is my favorite sport, and I have played it for ten years since I was in the middle school. My body is tall and slim, so I love imitating Kevin Durant's playing style. I enjoy R&B and pop music, often listening to and singing songs by David Tao and Jay Chou. I occasionally play the guitar, but my favorite pastime is playing video games on Nintendo Switch. The series I play include The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario, and Metroid.
